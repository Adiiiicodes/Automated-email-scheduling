# Email Automation System - The Ultimate Email Scheduler!

Welcome to the Email Automation System! 🎉 Ever wished you could just send out tons of emails without lifting a finger? Well, we’ve got you covered—kind of. This ambitious project aims to make your email life easier by scheduling emails to various recipients at various times.

## The Dream

We envisioned a sleek, GUI-based Desktop app that would take your email scheduling to the next level. You know, the kind of app where you just set it and forget it, while sipping your coffee. ☕️

## The Reality

The app is a work in progress, and here’s what’s currently on the plate:

- **Current Status**: 
  - The app can schedule emails, but it’s not exactly a smooth operator yet. After sending emails, it tends to hang around like that one guest who just doesn’t take the hint to leave. 🕵️‍♂️
  - Once you close the app, it’s like it’s on vacation—emails won’t be sent, and any scheduled tasks reset to null. Who knew email scheduling could be so rebellious? 🚪🚫

## The Best Tool for Cold Mailing

Looking to up your cold mailing game? Look no further! This tool is designed for cold mailing with the power to schedule emails to multiple recipients at different times. It’s your new best friend for sending out those outreach emails like a pro. 🥂📧

## Dependencies

To get this app up and running, you'll need the following Python packages:

- `tkinter` (for the GUI)
- `pywin32` (for Windows service management)
- `schedule` (for scheduling tasks)
- `smtplib` (for sending emails)
- `email` (for crafting email messages)

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pywin32 schedule
```

Note: `tkinter` and `smtplib` are included with Python, so you don't need to install them separately.
